# Branching Strategy

This document explains the branching strategy used in this project.

## Branch Types
- **main**: This is the stable production-ready branch.
- **feature branches**: Branches created for new features or fixes, named like `feature-xyz`.
- **pull requests**: Changes made in feature branches should be reviewed via pull requests before merging into `main`.

## Workflow
1. Create a new branch for a feature or bug fix.
2. Make changes and commit them.
3. Push the branch to GitHub.
4. Create a pull request for review.
5. Merge after review and delete the branch.
